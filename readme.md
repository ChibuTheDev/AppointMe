Team Project: APPOINT ME

Solution: We intend to solve the problem of inconvenience in making a doctor's appointment.
so our solution books an appointment for the user ahead of time, but if in any case, the user cannot make it to the hospital he/she can book for an appointment where a doctor and nurse would be assigned to come to check them up at the users convenience at a price(the website mode of generating income).
